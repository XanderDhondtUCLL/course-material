# Cake 3

Do we feel silly.
For a cake, we actually also need 200g butter and 250g sugar...
We summarize the necessary ingredients per cake:

| Ingredient | Amount per cake |
| :--------: | :-------------: |
| Eggs       | 5               |
| Flour      | 250g            |
| Butter     | 200g            |
| Sugar      | 250g            |

Who knew that making a cake was so complicated?

Write a function `cake3(eggs, flour, butter, sugar)` that returns the amount of cakes one can make given

* `eggs` number of eggs
* `flour` grams of flour
* `butter` grams of butter
* `sugar` grams of sugar

Typically, a function requires a specific number of arguments.
For example `cake3` expects exactly four arguments.
It is an error to pass it more or less arguments.

However, it is possible to deviate from this strict rule in multiple ways.
For example, `min` and `max` can take two _or more_ arguments.
E.g., `max(91, 549, 20, 403)` evaluates to `549`.
You will see later how to define such functions yourself.
